# scratch-cpu
A simple cpu i made in scratch.


https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1241317233/


(NOT IN GAME YET)WTR: writes to ram. example WTR 0322 0003

That would write the number 322 to the 3rd in the third register in ram.

(NOT IN GAME YET)RFR: reads a number from ram. example RFR 3 That would read the third from the third register in ram.

JMP: jumps to a line in the instructions example JMP 8 its obvious.

OPT: output to output. Z for a number you read from ram. example OPT 3354 output to output list:3354

CLR: clears the output list. can be used for gui i think. at this stage i havent added a input api.

DLY: delays the running in milliseconds
